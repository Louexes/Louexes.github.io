👨🏻‍💻 I am currently a final year student in Econometrics and Data Science at the University of Amsterdam

🤖 My interests lie in applying Machine Learning and Econonmetrics to solve real world problems.

👨🏻‍🔧 In my youth I competed in tennis tournaments in the UAE, eventually progressing to working as a part-time coach during my final years of high school. During my time at university I have taken on a position as an Academic Tutor and recently the Event Lead role at the UvA Google Student Developer Club. 

# Selected Experience 

## 👷‍♂️ Professional 

I have experience as an Academic Tutor for the Amsterdam based tutoring company [FBSB](https://www.fbsb.nl/). FBSB focuses exclusively on quantitative studies in the Netherlands. As a tutor I provided one on one as well as duo tutoring sessions for bachelors students, primarily covering statistics, mathematics and econometrics. I also wrote a full course summary for the BSc course Mathematics 1: Calculus which is available for purchase via FBSB. 

More recently I worked in a team with three other students as a Data Analyst for Dutch NGO [paxvorvreede](https://paxvoorvrede.nl/) through the Analytics Academy program at our university. As a non-profit organization paxvorvreede is dependent on donations and has limited financial capacities. Our job was to optimize their website traffic and use the collected data to provide insightful visualizations on things such as donation data and google ads data. The program also consisted of an educational part, such as a Python bootcamp which focused on preprocessing data for Machine Learning hosted by [Amsterdam Data Collective](https://amsterdamdatacollective.com/).

## 📊 Personal Projects

I have experience conducting independent research, most recently looking at developments in Uncertainty Quantifcation. I implemented some ideas from Angelopoulous & Bates (2023) surrounding Conformal Prediction. I applied it to quantile regression, in order to quantify the uncertainty present in estimating lower and upper quantiles of drug response data. This was to show the usefulness and universality of Conformal Prediction in achieving a desired coverage regardless of the underlying data generating process.

I am currently working on a Deep Learning project where I use data from OpenWeather to access historical weather data such as temperature, humidity, pressure and wind speed to train a Long short-term memory (LSTM) model. This is to create an accurate way to predict weather, capturing both short term and long term trends while also dealing with the vanishing gradient problem inherent to recurrent neural networks (RNN).
