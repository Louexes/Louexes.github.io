I am a Masters student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam as well as a Model Developer at SlimBieden. My interests lie in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Time Series Analysis, Econometrics and Uncertainty Quantification. In my current role at SlimBieden, I am part of the model development team where I am closely mentored by two PhD students in Financial Econometrics. My role involves improving the model, as well as researching state of the art Econometric and Machine Learning techniques from academic papers to accurately model the challenging Dutch housing market. 

# Selected Experience 

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Professional 

I previously worked as an Academic Tutor for the Amsterdam based tutoring company [FBSB](https://www.fbsb.nl/). FBSB focuses exclusively on quantitative studies in the Netherlands. As a tutor I provided one on one as well as duo tutoring sessions for bachelors students, primarily covering statistics, mathematics and econometrics. I also wrote a full course summary for the BSc course Mathematics 1: Calculus which is available for purchase via FBSB. 

More recently I worked in a team with three other students as a Data Analyst for Dutch NGO [Paxvorvreede](https://paxvoorvrede.nl/) through the Analytics Academy program at our university. As a non-profit organization paxvorvreede is dependent on donations and has limited financial capacities. Our job was to optimize their website traffic and use the collected data to provide insightful visualizations on things such as donation data and google ads data. The program also consisted of an educational part, such as a Python bootcamp which focused on preprocessing data for Machine Learning hosted by [Amsterdam Data Collective](https://amsterdamdatacollective.com/).

## üìä Personal Projects / Research 

My bachelor thesis titled "Robustifying Score-Driven Updates by the PseudoSpherical Scoring Rule" received a score of 8.6/10, one of the highest in my cohort. My thesis focused on robustifying score-driven (SD) models, which are popular tools for modelling time varying parameters in non-linear time series due to their responsive updating mechanism. The paper proposes the use of the strictly proper PseudoSpherical scoring rule (PsSphS), which holds promise in robustifying the updating step against outliers, which conventional SD models often fall victim to. I derive a Quasi-Score driven model, where in place of the gradient of the log-likelihood, the model maximizes the PsSphS in each updating step. Empirical findings support the theoretical proposition that the PsSphS effectively robustifies the updating step in the presence of outliers. For the interested reader, read my full thesis [here]{/files/Thesis.pdf}.

I also enjoy reading papers in my own time, most recently looking at developments in Uncertainty Quantifcation. I implemented some ideas from Angelopoulous & Bates (2023) surrounding Conformal Prediction. I applied it to quantile regression, in order to quantify the uncertainty present in estimating lower and upper quantiles of drug response data. This was to show the usefulness and universality of Conformal Prediction in achieving a desired coverage regardless of the underlying data generating process.
