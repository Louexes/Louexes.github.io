👨🏻‍💻 I'm currently a final year student in Econometrics and Data Science at the Univerity of Amsterdam

🤖 My interests currently lie in applying statistical machine learning techniques to quantify uncertainty.

👨🏻‍🔧 In my youth I competed in tennis tournaments in the UAE, eventually progressing to working as a part-time coach during my final years of high school. During my time in university I have taken on the position as an Academic Tutor, providing sessions for students from my own and related bachelors programs. Most recently I have taken on the role of Event Lead at the newly founded UvA Google Student Developer Club.
